# Contact Photos

An ([XPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/XPInstall)-based) Thunderbird add-on forked from [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/contact-photos](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/contact-photos).

Notable additions:

* Online User Directory for corporate badge photos
* [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/) Gravatars
* Photos based on first To recipient in Sent, Drafts, and Outbound folders

You can download my fork of Contact Photos 1.0.1 here:
* [contact_photos+adamhotep-1.0.1-1.xpi](https://github.com/adamhotep/contact-photos/raw/master/contact_photos%2Badamhotep-1.0.1-1.xpi)

Note, it is not signed; you may need to tweak your about:config to allow that.
